Please set up this project for a political ideologies map. I want a simple single page where there is a map with the famous four quadrants as a grid on it, being movable.

For now, let's just implement this map, making it interactive. The map is like a canvas, and the quadrant are in the known colors: top left is red, top right is blue, bottom left is green, bottom right is yellow.

You can move the map around by dragging it, zoom in and out by scrolling, that should be it for now.

Ignore the political-compass repo for now as we will later implement the weights into it. I just want the canvas.

Use typescript, nextjs, shadcn ui, and whatever libraries you think are necessary.
